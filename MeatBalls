  <h1>Homemade Meatballs with Onion and Chili</h1>
  <p>Juicy homemade meatballs made with finely chopped onion, salt, black pepper, and a little kick of chili. Great with potatoes, gravy, or as a simple dinner.</p>

  <h2>Ingredients (serves 4)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>600 g ground beef</li>
    <li>1 yellow onion (about 120 g), finely chopped</li>
    <li>1 red chili (about 10–15 g), finely chopped</li>
    <li>10 g salt</li>
    <li>3 g black pepper (about 1 tsp)</li>
    <li>30 ml water</li>
    <li>20 ml neutral cooking oil (for frying)</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Instructions</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Add the ground beef to a mixing bowl.</li>
    <li>Add chopped onion, chili, salt, black pepper, and water.</li>
    <li>Mix well for 2–3 minutes until the mixture becomes smooth and slightly sticky. (This helps keep the meatballs juicy.)</li>
    <li>Shape the mixture into meatballs using slightly wet hands. Make them about 5–6 cm wide.</li>
    <li>Heat a frying pan over medium-high heat and add the oil.</li>
    <li>Fry the meatballs for 3–4 minutes per side until nicely browned.</li>
    <li>Lower the heat slightly and cook for another 4–6 minutes until fully cooked through.</li>
    <li>Let the meatballs rest for 2 minutes before serving.</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>Tips</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>For a milder flavor: use half the chili or remove the seeds.</li>
    <li>For extra juicy meatballs: add a bit more water (up to 50 ml) and mix a little longer.</li>
    <li>If making larger meatballs: cook a little longer on lower heat so they cook through without drying out.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Required Equipment</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Mixing bowl</li>
    <li>Cutting board and knife</li>
    <li>Frying pan</li>
    <li>Spatula</li>
